## Abstract:
The files and codes presented in this repository refer to the construction of the ballbot robot. This robot rides on top of a basketball, and falls into a recent category of omnidirectional robots. In addition to the construction, files are available for the implementation of the camera location system, autonomous waypoint navigation and object tracking system.
